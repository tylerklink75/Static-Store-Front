         <h1>How we got our start</h1>
         <p>We were started by a group of students based out of the Indianapolis area who had grown up skiing there whole entire life.  They noticed that Indianapolis did not have very many ski shops in the area and decided to open
             one of their own. Even though Indianapolis does not have very many ski resorts in the area we noticed that their was still a market despite the long trek either east or west to get to the mountain.  They were founded in 2019 and have some of the type skis in the market.</p>
        <p>You will see the same brands here that you will see anywhere else for a way better price.  The goal when they opened the ski shop was to become the best selling ski store in indianapois and they have succeeded.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for some of the best ski resorts in the whole entire world my best advice would be to go out west. You can not beat skiing down the beautiful rocky mountains especially on one of Indy's finest skis or boards.</p>
